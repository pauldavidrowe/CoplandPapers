  This file will start by being a direct translation
  from the Coq source used to verify the results in
  the paper "Evidence Tampering and Chain of Custody
  in Layered Attestations".

  In fact, the Coq source for this file contains a bunch
  of stuff that should already be in Mathlib. I will
  only add things here as needed (if at all).
